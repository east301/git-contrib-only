git-p4 - Perforce <-> Git converter using git-fast-import

Usage
=====

git-p4 supports two main modes: Importing from Perforce to a Git repository is
done using "git-p4 sync". Submitting changes from Git back to Perforce is
done using "git-p4 submit".

Importing
=========

The procedure is simple:

  mkdir repo-git
  cd repo-git
  git init
  git-p4 sync //path/in/your/perforce/depot

This will import the current head revision of the specified depot path into a
"p4" branch of your git repository. You can use the --branch=mybranch option
to use a different branch.

If you want to import the entire history of a given depot path just use

  git-p4 sync //path/in/depot@all

To achieve optimal compression you may want to run 'git repack -a -d -f' after
a big import. This may take a while.

Support for Perforce integrations is still work in progress. Don't bother
trying it unless you want to hack on it :)


Incremental Imports
===================

After an initial import you can easily synchronize your git repository with
newer changes from the Perforce depot by just calling

  git-p4 sync

in your git repository.

It is recommended to run 'git repack -a -d -f' from time to time when using
incremental imports to optimally combine the individual git packs that each
incremental import creates through the use of git-fast-import.

Submitting
==========

git-p4 has support for submitting changes from a git repository back to the
Perforce depot. This requires a Perforce checkout separate to your git
repository. To submit all changes that are in the current git branch but not in
the "p4" branch (or "origin" if "p4" doesn't exist) simply call

    git-p4 submit

in your git repository. If you want to submit changes in a specific branch that
is not your current git branch you can also pass that as an argument:

    git-p4 submit mytopicbranch

You can override the reference branch with the --origin=mysourcebranch option.

If a submit fails you may have to "p4 resolve" and submit manually. You can
continue importing the remaining changes with

  git-p4 submit --continue

After submitting you should sync your perforce import branch ("p4" or "origin")
from Perforce using git-p4's sync command.
